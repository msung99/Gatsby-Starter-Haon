  Gatsby's default starter
</h1>

Kick off your project with this default boilerplate. This starter ships with the main Gatsby configuration files you might need to get up and running blazing fast with the blazing fast app generator for React.

## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI ([install instructions](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/getting-started/part-0/#gatsby-cli)) to create a new site, specifying the default starter.

    ```shell
    # create a new Gatsby site using the default starter
    gatsby new my-default-starter https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd my-default-starter/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    Note: You'll also see a second link: `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby Tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/getting-started/part-4/#use-graphiql-to-explore-the-data-layer-and-write-graphql-queries).

    Open the `my-default-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a typical Gatsby project.

    .
    ├── node_modules
    ├── src
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── gatsby-browser.js
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── gatsby-node.js
    ├── gatsby-ssr.js
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── package.json
    └── README.md

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

1.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

1.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

1.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-browser/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

1.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

1.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-node/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

1.  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-ssr/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

1.  **`LICENSE`**: This Gatsby starter is licensed under the 0BSD license. This means that you can see this file as a placeholder and replace it with your own license.

1.  **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

1.  **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
