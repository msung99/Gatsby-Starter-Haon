# Gatsby Starter Haon

![](./static/readme/theme.png)

While using various popular blogging platforms, I wanted to address and improve the inconveniences I encountered. Therefore, I created this blog theme. I hope this theme will be helpful for those who want to customize and operate their own blogs like I do. Feel free to customize and use the Gatsby Haon Theme! üëã

## 0. Create a GitHub Repository

Before installing the theme, you need a GitHub repository for your Gatsby Theme. Please create one.

---

## 1. Installing the Theme üëã

Follow the steps below to create your own blog theme!

```
gatsby new your-blog-name https://github.com/msung99/Gatsby-Starter-Haon.git
```

---

## 2. Running Gatsby Local Server

Once you have downloaded the theme to your local machine, follow the steps below to run the Gatsby local server.

```
cd your-blog-name
npm install  // install node.js
gatsby develop // or "npm start"
```

If the above commands run without any issues, you can check the initial state of your blog at http://localhost:8000!

## 3. Entering Blog Information

You can directly input your meta information to customize the theme. If you navigate to `gatsby-config.js`, you will see the initial state as follows:

```js
module.exports = {
  siteMetadata: {
    title: `haon.blog`,
    description: `Hello! This is a tech blog theme using Gatsby ü§©`,
    author: `Haon`,
    siteUrl: `https://gatsby-starter-haon.netlify.app/`,
    keywords: [`server`, `backend`, `gatsby`],
    repo: "msung99/Gatsby-Starter-Haon",
    socialLinks: {
      github: "https://github.com/msung99",
      instagram: "https://www.instagram.com/iminseong920",
      facebook: "https://www.facebook.com/",
      linkedin: "https://www.linkedin.com/",
      velog: "https://velog.io/@msung99",
      email: `https://msung6924@naver.com`,
    },
  },
  plugins: [
    // ... (omitted)
  ],
}
```

Modify the `siteMetadata` as follows:

### 3-1. Basic Profile Settings

Input your basic profile information.

```
title: ``, // haon.blog
description: ``, // Hello! This is a tech blog theme using Gatsby ü§©
author: ``, // Haon
siteUrl: ``, // https://gatsby-starter-haon.netlify.app/
keywords: [ ], // [`server`, `backend`, `gatsby`]
```

### 3-2. Utterances (Comments) Configuration

This template is based on the issue creation-based comment system. Input your GitHub repository information for smooth comment functionality activation.

```
repo: "your-github-name/repository-name"  //  "msung99/Gatsby-Starter-Haon",
```

### 3-3. Social Links Integration

Lastly, you can integrate your social media accounts. This is required for the feature where clicking on social icons navigates to the respective URLs. Customize the desired fields from the below social accounts:

```
socialLinks: {
  github: ""  // "https://github.com/msung99",
  instagram: ""  // "https://www.instagram.com/iminseong920",
  facebook: ""  // "https://www.facebook.com/",
  linkedin: ""  // "https://www.linkedin.com/",
  velog: ""  // "https://velog.io/@msung99",
  email: ""  // `https://msung6924@naver.com`,
},
```

## 4. Deploying the Blog

You can quickly create your blog on `Github Page` or `Netlify`, depending on your preferred deployment environment. Here, I'll briefly mention Netlify.

By utilizing the button below, you can integrate your GitHub repository with Netlify to deploy your blog. You may need your GitHub repository for this process, which you should have created earlier.

<a href="https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/msung99/Gatsby-Starter-Haon.git" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg" alt="Deploy to Netlify"></a>
